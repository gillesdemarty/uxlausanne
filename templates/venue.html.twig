            <h3 >Thursday Evening <strong>Twerk</strong></h3>
            <p>On Thursdsay evening, UX Lausanne invites you to expand your mind with the show <a href="http://www.arsenic.ch/programme/altered-natives-excess-twerk/">Twerk</a>.
            <p>For this dance collective performance, Cecilia Bengolea and François Chaignaud draw on their teenage years where they have been going to discos and have turned it into a place where to practise. From London to NYC, they go from club to club: drum&amp;bass, jungle, dubstep, reggae, bashement, house, voguing, hype as anthropological research centres. That is where they have become familiar with and learnt Jamaican dancehall, krump, house, split &amp; jump… – dances which, regardless of their formal and spiritual differences, have a certain playfulness in common (with music, and between the technical principles and the ideals determining them).</p>
            <p>This work and this playful writing process are achieved in close relation to a musical investigation around Grime music. As an electro music that comes from East London in the early 2000s, Grime combines, mixes and transforms sounds from dancehall, hip-hop and UK garage.</p>
            <p>The syncretic ferociousness of this style, which seems to be hanging between two contradictory speeds, between the abstraction of synthetic sounds and MCs’ sensual emergency, interacts with the various influences which have inspired the dances.</p>

            <h3 >Closing Party <strong>Le Bourg Plage</strong></h3>
            <p>We decided to get you to the best place for the closing party.</p>
            <p>In the middle of city center, this bar takes place under the Bessiere'sbridge.</p>
            <p> This bar and theater/music venue is literally in the shadow of the cathedral. When the weather is nice and you want a cold beer to go with the warm summer sun, and possibly catch some live music, this is the place to be.</p>
            <p>This place is really tucked away since it is built in between the two “tiers” of the city and uses a huge stone arch of Pont Bessières as its ceiling and walls. To get there, go to the cathedral-side of Pont Bessières on the south side of the street and take the stairs down under the bridge.</p>
