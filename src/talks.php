        'description' => "There was a time when we did pretty page designs and when those designs were pretty much what we saw in our desktop browsers. With the introduction and rise of smartphones, tablets, phablets - as well as a bigger variety in larger and smaller screens - there isn’t one view of our designs anymore. Instead, what we design need to be able to adapt so that it’s displayed in a way that is suitable for the device that is being used. <br>With responsive design we’ve learnt the basics of how to adapt content, interactions and layouts so that it works across devices. But with further developments in technology and screens, our content is going to go anywhere and we need to move away from designing for specific devices. For us as UX designers this means means letting content rather than devices guide layouts, but also increasingly moving away from designing and wireframing pages and instead focusing on the modules that those pages are made up of. <br>The device agnostic design approach places a bigger weight on our shoulders in terms of ensuring that what we design will in fact work across devices, irrespectively of what device that is used. As a result we need to be clever in how we approach design, development and specification to ensure we spend our resources appropriately, but also that we build something that can adapt to as many different platforms and screen sizes as possible. <br />In this workshop you’ll get a thorough understanding of and hands on experience with:<ul><li>why we should do device agnostic design</li><li>the basics of modular and device agnostic design</li><li>what it means to approach a project in a modular way</li><li>how to go about doing it </li><li>module libraries and how to use them using content as the basis for responsive design breakpoints</li></ul>",

We believe that, by studying the way your fellow project team members work, what their needs are, and what & how they deliver, you can develop another type of empathy, one that may prove to be more important for business success and results in a delightful work environment. </p><p>In the first half of this workshop, we want to walk you through the design process and the people you will meet on the way, mostly from outside of your design team's environment. We will show how your skills and contributions allow you to influence their work and, indirectly, the resulting end-user experience.<br/>Peter will explain that documenting your organization's design process allows you to sell your work better, to train new team members easier, to maintain a consistent vocabulary for your team, and to measure and improve your team’s effectiveness.<br/>Activities in this part will include sketching organizational charts and design process diagrams to identify the relevant people to influence, as well as specifying input and deliverables that will help your organization to identify, design and build successful user experiences. The end-result is a plan to improve your process.</p><p>In the second half, we will focus on how to successfully communicate your contributions to different stakeholders during the design process.<br/>Birgit will explain the concept of communication styles, and show you how to identify your own style and that of co-workers. She will teach you how to adapt your own style to others to ensure you will be heard during a project, and help you to overcome conflicts. <br/> Activities in this part will include discussing a typical work-related communication problem; finding a solution and gaining a common ground; a self evaluation exercise; applying the communication styles on the earlier introduced problem and finding more effective ways to solve this (and other) challenges.</p><p>We believe that by paying attention to these two aspects, process and people, you will develop that other kind of empathy, the kind that makes you a better participant in the design process, helps you communicate your designs better, while enjoying your work more.

Our work is focussed on meeting and exceeding user needs, however this is often clouded by communication failures between ourselves and stakeholders. How many times have you known that a team has not read a report you’ve written? Or have not read the annotations you’ve carefully added to wireframes or prototypes?</p><p>UX comics get read. And they get shared amongst stakeholder teams. They get pinned to walls, emailed, saved and most importantly, they get talked about. Comics delight and surprise people and this makes them a very powerful tool.</p><p>UX Comics are a great way to communicate ideas, events and processes with clients, team members and end users - so they can be used throughout the user experience workflow. They are quick and simple to produce once you know how and this practical, hands-on workshop will give you the methods and tools you need to start making your own UX comics.</p><p>I will explain why comics are such a powerful communication method, and share examples of how I use comics in my work, and how other people are using comics.</p><p>You do not need to be a skilled artist to take part, all you need is a willingness to pick up a pencil and have a go. By the end of the session you will have produced your very first UX comic, as well as a set of characters and reference materials you can use to continue making comics in the future.</p> <h5>What will you learn?</h5><ul><li>The art and science of making UX comics</li><li>How to draw people and emotions confidently</li><li>How to structure stories around research data.</li><li>A brief history of comics</li><li>See real-life UX comics and how they are used today</li></ul>",
